This is an app prototype for government subsidy management, submitted as a piece to the ' 2025 AI Convergence Policy Development Hackathon' (co-hosted by _Chungcheongbuk-do Province, Korea_ and _Chungbuk Innovation Institute of Science & Technology_).

Chungcheongbuk-do Province is a rapidly evolving province, expanding its subsidies for startups, local kindergartens, and businesses. However, these subsidies are managed mainly by the provincial government. Recipients face various difficulties, including a confusing range of uses, late notice of use for other purposes, and difficulty in getting answers to their questions quickly.
The government's _Boteam-E_ does offer functions to upload and record recipients' usage. Still, this doesn't fill the needs of the recipients. We found recipients uploading their questions on an online blog, but couldn't get sufficient answers.
Some recipients went through the redemption arrangement, and the Government report also reveals that 7% of recipients got into trouble for unreported use of the money for other purposes. We can expect the redemption rate and amount of cash in Chungcheongbuk-do Province to increase in the near future.

Therefore, we designed a new application, **Botaem-E-Plus**.
Botaem-E-Plus includes a chatbot _Taemi_ (functioned by Chat GPT 4o, a prompt including related policies and rules, and an easier usage record adder operated by Google Vision API (OCR). It also provides a summary of use and an easy view of all records.

We believe Botaem-E-Plus will make recipients' subsidy management easier (can quickly report subsidy usage using OCR, can ask urgent questions using chatbot), will lessen subsidy usage-related problems (e.g., use of other purposes) in advance, and lastly have expandability as a government governance.
